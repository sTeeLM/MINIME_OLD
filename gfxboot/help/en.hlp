label_harddiskBoot from Local Hard Disk: This selection does not affect the installed system. It only starts a previously installed operating system.
label_hdtHardware Detection Tool: This selection will launch a tool for checking your hardware. This tool does not affect or determine the hardware used for installing MINIME.
label_memtestMemory Test: Memory testing is useful for more than checking installation of new memory modules. It is a stress test for a big part of your computer system and may indicate hardware problems.
noacpiACPI Disabled: Many of the currently-sold computers have incomplete or faulty ACPI implementations. This selection disables ACPI support in the kernel, but still enables many performance features, like DMA for IDE hard disks.
nolapicLocal APIC Disabled: If the normal installation fails, this might be due to the system hardware not supporting local APIC. If this seems to be the case, use this option to install without local APIC support.
optBoot Options: The boot options may change the behavior of your system completely. They are settings for the kernel.
helpF1 Help: This is context sensitive. It will show different screens depending on the active element of the boot screen. There is also a description of this help system available.
keytableF2: Set language and keyboard mapping used by the boot loader.
videomodeF3 Video Mode: Here, choose between different screen resolutions while installing.

to learn how to update system, read updateupdate.
other options:
1. rd.live.overlay=[devspec]:[filespec] : set location of overlay file, ex: rd.live.overlay=LABEL=SYSTEM:/overlay.img
2. rd.live.overlay.reset : reset overlay to zero to drop any change.
3. rd.live.overlay.size : set overlay size in MB, default value is 512.
4. rd.live.overlay.merge : merge overlay to generate new squashfs.img, temp space needed (local disk).
Return to mainBoot Loader HelpupdateUpdateTo update MINIME system:
1. Backup /isolinux/initrd0.img and /isolinux/vmlinuz0 of the usb stick.
2. Boot system with label_overlayoverlay support. Default location of overlay file is /LiveOS/overlay-MINIME-xxxx-xxxx on the usb stick, (x is hex number), you can change rd.live.overlay option to use local disk as overlay space instead of usb stick.
3. Make changes (yum update), if kernel is changed, use "dracut -c /etc/minime.conf --xz new.img [new kernel verson]" to create new initrd0.img. Be sure to copy new initrd image/kernel to /isolinux/initrd0.img and /isolinux/vmlinuz0.
4. Reboot system with rd.live.overlay.merge option, select a local disk as temp space. This process will merge squashfs.img and overlay to create new squashfs.img.
5. Reboot system normally, use "dracut -c /etc/minime.conf --xz new.img" to create new initrd0.img again, this process will update build version and build date.Be sure to replace /isolinux/initrd0.img with new.img.
6. Remove all backup file, localtion of backup squashfs.img is on local disk.
7. In case of failure, restore old kernel, initrd and squashfs.img, fix error, do whole process again.
Return to label_overlayMINIME System (KDE with overlay)label_pe_x64Windows PE x64this option boot Windows PE for x64.
Return to mainBoot Loader Helplabel_pe_x86Window PEx86)this option boot Windows PE for x86.

Return to mainBoot Loader Helplabel_ramMINIME SYSTEM (All in RAM)The MINIME system provides a live Linux with GNOME/KDE desktop manager, and lots of tools.
Select this option to start using the MINIME with CLI interface, and run in RAM completely.
Return to mainBoot Loader HelpnoacpiACPI DisabledCurrent hardware usually requires ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) to control the interrupt handling. ACPI completely replaces the old APM system.
Select ACPI Disabled if you encounter problems during boot of the kernel. Known problems with machines that have problems with ACPI are: 
  • kernel freezes when booting  • PCI Cards are not detected or initialized properly
Return to mainBoot Loader HelpnolapicLocal APIC DisabledNormally there are no problems with the APIC (Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller). But if you seem to have some, try this option to boot without local APIC support.
Please don't confuse this with noacpiACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface).
Return to mainBoot Loader HelpoptBoot Optionskernel options 
  • o_apmapm -- toggle power management  • o_acpiacpi -- advanced configuration and power interface  • o_ideide -- control the IDE subsystem
Return to mainBoot Loader Helpo_acpiKernel Options: acpiACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) is a standard that defines power and configuration management interfaces between an operating system and the BIOS. By default, acpi is switched on when a BIOS is detected that is newer than from year 2000. There are several commonly used parameters to control the behavior of ACPI: 
  • pci=noacpi -- do not use ACPI to route PCI interrupts  • acpi=oldboot -- only the parts of ACPI that are relevant for booting remain activated  • acpi=off -- switch off ACPI completely  • acpi=force -- switch on ACPI even if your BIOS is dated before 2000
Especially on new computers, it replaces the old o_apmapm system.
Return to optBoot Optionso_apmKernel Options: apmAPM is one of the two power management strategies used on current computers. It is mainly used with laptops for functions like suspend to disk, but it may also be responsible for switching off the computer after power down. APM relies on a correct working BIOS. If the BIOS is broken, APM may have only limited use or even prevent the computer from working. Therefore, it may be switched off with the parameter 
  • apm=off -- switch off APM completely
Some very new computers may take more advantage from the newer o_acpiACPI.
Return to optBoot Optionso_ideKernel Options: ideIDE is, unlike SCSI, commonly used in most desktop workstations. To circumvent some hardware problems that occur with IDE systems, use the kernel parameter: 
  • ide=nodma -- switch off DMA for IDE drives
Return to optBoot OptionsvideomodeVideo Mode SelectionPress F3 to get the list of video modes your graphics card supports. The highest mode your monitor can display is preselected.
It is possible that your monitor cannot be detected automatically. In that case, select your preferred mode manually.
If your system has problems with the graphics card during the installation, the text mode may be a usable work-around.
