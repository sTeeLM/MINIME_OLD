# Fedora Beefy Miracle theme for GRUB2
#
# Copyright (C) 2011 Daniel Tschudi, (c) 2012 Máirín Duffy
# 
# This theme is derived from Daniel Tschudi's 'Starfield' grub2 theme.
# The graphics have been changed from a lighter color to a darker color,
# the size of the boot menu box has been scaled down, and the colors 
# have been changed for both the text and progress bar. The highlighted
# menu icon has also been removed.
